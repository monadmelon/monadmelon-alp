# Objects in "C"

In C, Objects are entities that occupy memory and store data. The main types of objects are:

1. Variables (Locations in memory) – store a single value of a specific datatype in memory which can also be modified during program
                                     execution.

                                     Examples: `int x;`, `float y;`

2. Arrays (continugious block of memory that contains multiple variables that are the same type) – store multiple values of the same 
                                                                                                   datatype in contiguous memory.
                                                                                                   (STRINGS are just an array of characters btw)

                                                                                                    Example: `int arr[10];`
                                                                                                             'char str[] = "Hello";'


3. Pointers  – store memory addresses of other objects.

    Example: `int *ptr;`

4. Structures (`struct`) – group different types of variables under one name.

    Example: `struct Point { int x; int y; };`

5. Unions (`union`) – similar to structs but share the same memory for all members.

    Example: `union Data { int i; float f; char c; };`

6. Enumerations (`enum`)** – named integer constants.

    Example: `enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };`

7. Typedef-defined objects** – custom names for existing types.

    Example: `typedef unsigned int uint;`
